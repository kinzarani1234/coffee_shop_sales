This project performs predictive analytics on a coffee shop’s transaction dataset to evaluate product performance, forecast revenue, and provide data-driven strategies for increasing profitability and reducing losses.

## 📌 Objective

- Analyze and clean sales transaction data.
- Identify profitable and loss-incurring products/services.
- Use machine learning and time series models to forecast revenue and transaction quantities.
- Recommend actionable strategies for profit growth and loss mitigation.

## 🔍 Key Tasks

### Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized column formats, and ensured proper datetime conversions.

### Profit & Loss Analysis
- Visualized revenue by product category and detail.
- Compared quantity sold vs. revenue across products to determine high/low performers.

### Predictive Modeling
- Applied **Random Forest**, **ARIMA**, and **Prophet** models for forecasting:
  - Monthly and daily revenue
  - Transaction quantity trends
- Predicted product-level revenue uplift potential.

### Loss Mitigation Strategy
- Identified low-selling and low-revenue products.
- Analyzed factors contributing to losses.
- Suggested potential steps for improving or replacing underperforming items.
